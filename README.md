Project: Aviation Accident Analysis

Snapshot: This project develved into aviation data to inform decisions at a company with business interests in air transport.

Overview

In order to make informed investment decision, trends, patterns including the magnitudes of aviation accidents and incidents are key. This Project examines data from aircraft accidents. In this case, a company is at crossroads and need to make educated decisions on aircraft purchases and operations. The analysis attempts to offer practical insights. 
The principal aim is generate evidence to influence the choice of aircrafts to be purchased

Methodologies

A well-known industry standard for data science projects, CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is used in the analysis. The Python programming language is used for data transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization while following PEP 8 style rules.

Key analytical techniques and tools include:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The raw aviation accident data is meticulously cleaned and transformed to ensure data quality and consistency. This involves handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating new features for enhanced analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the data, identify trends, and uncover potential relationships between variables. This involves descriptive statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to create informative visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps, to effectively communicate findings and insights.

Guidance

Data Requirements: The analysis requires a CSV file named "AviationData.csv" containing aviation accident data. The file should include relevant fields such as aircraft make and model, engine type, phase of flight, weather conditions, injury severity, and location details.

Python Environment: Ensure you have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Execution: Run the Python script to perform the analysis. The script will generate visualizations and insights based on the provided data.

Interpretation: Carefully interpret the findings and consider the limitations of the analysis. The insights can be used to inform decision-making regarding aircraft selection, including flight operations maintenance practices, and safety protocols.

Disclaimer

This analysis is intended for informational purposes only and should not be considered as a substitute for professional aviation safety advice. The findings and recommendations are based on the available data including the limitations thereof e.g unresolved missing values where factual data is expected and cannot be filled with zeros. As such, the observations may not be applicable to all aviation scenarios. Always consult with qualified aviation professionals for specific safety guidance.
